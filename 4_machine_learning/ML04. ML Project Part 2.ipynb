We successfully imported and explored the data and then built a heuristic measure based upon the sex of the passengers and a Logistic Regression model in order to provide ourselves with a baseline measure of performance. These both measured just under **80%** in terms of accuracy.\n",

Looking at our `pclass`, `age` and `family_size` variables, these are all quantative and discrete in that the value relates to a scale. However our `sex` and `title` variables are qualatative or categorical data encoded as numbers. We want our algorithm to treat these two types of variable differently, otherwise it will think that they are discrete and continuous variables also. So what's the solution to this? The answer is a technique called One Hot Encoding."

    "[One Hot Encoding](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-one-hot-encoding-why-and-when-do-you-have-to-use-it-e3c6186d008f) is a process by which categorical variables are converted into a form that could be provided to ML algorithms to do a better job in prediction. If we were to feed our dataset into an algorithm 'as-is' it would interpret the `title` mathematically (e.g. Mr + Mr = Mrs or 1 + 1 = 2). To combat this, we need to create a separate binary variable for each categorical value (e.g. Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master etc.) and assign a value of 1 (hot) if that value is applicable to the record or 0 (cold) if it's not. You'll see that the 'hot' and 'cold' terminology simply means a binary variable where one of the variables is 'hot' for each of the categorical values.\n",

    "It's probably better illustrated than explained so we'll do this with pandas. Note that scikit-learn has a one-hot encoder also, but since we've done the rest of our feature engineering in pandas, we'll stick with it and explore how to do it in scikit-learn later on in the course. The method for doing so is called `get_dummies()`"
